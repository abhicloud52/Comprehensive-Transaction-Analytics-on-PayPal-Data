- SQL scripts for data extraction, aggregation, and advanced transactional analysis.
- Metrics include transaction amounts, frequency, customer loyalty, conversion trends, and merchant performance.
- Includes complex queries classified by difficulty level (Easy, Moderate, Hard) for progressive learning and analysis.
- Useful for stakeholders in finance and e-commerce domains for decision support.

## Getting Started
1. Import the provided `PayPal_Dataset_Project.sql` file into your MySQL or compatible database environment.
2. Execute queries as documented in the SQL script to generate reports and analytics.
3. Modify or extend queries as per your analytical requirements.

## Prerequisites
- MySQL Server or compatible SQL database system.
- MySQL Workbench or any preferred SQL client tool.

## Files Included
- `PayPal_Dataset_Project.sql`: SQL project file containing tables, data schema, and analysis queries.

## Usage
